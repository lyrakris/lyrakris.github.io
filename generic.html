										<h2>Scratch Maze Game</h2>
									</header>
									<p> The Scratch programming model is a visual, block-based coding environment designed to help users—especially beginners—learn programming concepts by snapping together code blocks like puzzle pieces. It simplifies logic, sequencing, and control structures, making it easy to create interactive stories, games, and animations without needing to write traditional code.</p>
									<div class="content">

											<span class="image left"><img src="images/blocks.jpg" alt="" /></span>
												<h2>How it Works</h2>
												<p> It works by letting users drag and snap together colored code blocks (as seen on the left) that represent different commands, controlling characters (called sprites) and actions on the screen. The program runs the blocks in sequence, allowing users to build logic, animations, and interactions visually. I had a lot of fun using this program and making a maze game out of it! Below you can try playing the game I created!</p>
		
												<h2 align="right">Play my game!</h2>
												<p align="right> Click on the green flag and then the start button to begin! You can control the sprite using the arrow keys. Avoid the walls and keep track of the timer on the top left! Go get the cake!</p>

										<h2>Python</h2>
									</header>
									<p> Python is a high-level, versatile programming language known for its clear syntax and readability, making it accessible for beginners and powerful for experts. It's widely used in fields like data science, web development, automation, and artificial intelligence. Python supports multiple programming paradigms and has a large library ecosystem, allowing for efficient and scalable problem-solving.</p>

												<h2>What did I do?</h2>
												<p> Using data collected from a kinesiology experiment, I created a graph using Python progamming to plot the relationships of FECO<sub>2</sub> and VCO<sub>2</sub> against V&#775;O<sub>2</sub>, highlighting their respective physiological thresholds. This visualization allowed for a clearer understanding of the body's metabolic response during exercise, particularly in identifying points such as the ventilatory threshold and the onset of anaerobic metabolism. By analyzing these variables together, we can gain valuable insight into respiratory efficiency and cardiovascular function during graded physical activity. <b>Click on the image to the right to access the page or <a href="https://github.com/lyrakris/KNES381/blob/13f5601dec61c1530280e90813d93010a8e9aa61/PythonAssignment.ipynb">click this link</a>!</b></p>

										<h2>Excel </h2>
									</header>
									<p>Excel is a spreadsheet software developed by Microsoft that allows users to organize, analyze, and visualize data using tables, formulas, and charts. It’s widely used for tasks like budgeting, data tracking, and statistical analysis. With its powerful tools and functions, Excel helps users manage large amounts of data efficiently and make data-driven decisions.</p>

												<h2>What features did I use? </h2>
												<p> Using kinesiology collected data, I made a PivotTale that analyzed performance metrics such as the average of cyclists, runners, swimmers, and triathlon athelete's vertical jump, 20m sprint, as well as their VO<sub>2max</sub>. I made a custom calculated field for efficiency and risk and slicers that is able to be filtered by age and experience level. I also included a visual chart linked to the PivotTable. With the spreadsheet, I implemented conditional formatting based on the injury risk formula as well as creating a custom formula for sleep quality. <b>Click on the image to the left to view this Excel sheet or <a href="https://1drv.ms/x/c/0da20ef6341cbec8/EXleaWXmyItOjueEtJ4z7a0Bap2WW9hSKuEHJI-DDxtcig?e=BD4J0u">click this link</a>!</b></p>

									<p>Dartfish is a video analysis software company specializing in tools that enable coaches, athletes, and medical professionals to capture, analyze, and share video footage for performance improvement and rehabilitation. Their solutions, including features like real-time event tagging and motion analysis, are utilized across various sports and healthcare settings to provide detailed insights into technique and strategy. </p>

												<h2>Dartfish</h2>
												<p>This is a video of a track and field sprinter's start being analyzed via the Dartfish software. It particularly does this by breaking the video down into segments via the frozen shots and provides comments and advice to improve their form such as joint angles and the push-off force needed. Although this isn't a comprehensive display of all the features Dartfish offers, you can also add timers, measure relative distances in the video, and include voice recordings! They also offer a mobile app option which allows this form of data analysis to be more portable and useful in more casual settings such as in a case with a personal trainer with their client.</p>

										<h2> Graphic Analysis </h2>
									</header>
									<p>GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) is a free, open-source image editing software used for tasks like photo retouching, image composition, and graphic design. It offers a wide range of powerful tools similar to Photoshop, including layers, masks, filters, and customizable brushes. It is a versatile tool for both beginners and advanced users! </p>

												<h2> GIMP </h2>
												<p>These are before and after images demonstrating my use of GIMP to perform a series of image editing tasks. Specifically, I applied photo rotation to adjust alignment, performed color correction and replacement to enhance visual quality, and used layering techniques to seamlessly overlay one image onto another such as a new background. These edits showcase GIMP’s versatility in combining technical precision with creative control for effective visual manipulation. </p>
