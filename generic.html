										<h2>Scratch Maze Game</h2>
									</header>
									<p> The Scratch programming model is a visual, block-based coding environment designed to help users—especially beginners—learn programming concepts by snapping together code blocks like puzzle pieces. It simplifies logic, sequencing, and control structures, making it easy to create interactive stories, games, and animations without needing to write traditional code.</p>

											<span class="image left"><img src="images/blocks.jpg" alt="" /></span>
												<h2>How it Works</h2>
												<p> It works by letting users drag and snap together colored code blocks (as seen on the left) that represent different commands, controlling characters (called sprites) and actions on the screen. The program runs the blocks in sequence, allowing users to build logic, animations, and interactions visually. I had a lot of fun using this program and making a maze game out of it! Below you can try playing the game I created!</p>
		
												<h2>Play my game!</h2>
												<p> Click on the green flag and then the start button to begin! You can control the sprite using the arrow keys. Avoid the walls and keep track of the timer on the top left! Go get the cake!</p>

										<h2>Python</h2>
									</header>
									<p> Python is a high-level, versatile programming language known for its clear syntax and readability, making it accessible for beginners and powerful for experts. It's widely used in fields like data science, web development, automation, and artificial intelligence. Python supports multiple programming paradigms and has a large library ecosystem, allowing for efficient and scalable problem-solving.</p>

												<h2>What did I do?</h2>
												<p> Using data collected from a kinesiology experiment, I created a graph using Python progamming to plot the relationships of FECO₂ and VCO₂ against V&#775;O₂, highlighting their respective physiological thresholds. This visualization allowed for a clearer understanding of the body's metabolic response during exercise, particularly in identifying points such as the ventilatory threshold and the onset of anaerobic metabolism. By analyzing these variables together, we can gain valuable insight into respiratory efficiency and cardiovascular function during graded physical activity. </p>

										<h2>Excel </h2>
									</header>
									<p>Excel is a spreadsheet software developed by Microsoft that allows users to organize, analyze, and visualize data using tables, formulas, and charts. It’s widely used for tasks like budgeting, data tracking, and statistical analysis. With its powerful tools and functions, Excel helps users manage large amounts of data efficiently and make data-driven decisions.</p>

												<h2>What features did I use? </h2>
												<p> Using kinesiology collected data, I made a PivotTale that analyzed performance metrics such as the average of cyclists, runners, swimmers, and triathlon athelete's vertical jump, 20m sprint, as well as their VO₂max. I made a custom calculated field for efficiency and risk and slicers that is able to be filtered by age and experience level. I also included a visual chart linked to the PivotTable. With the spreadsheet, I implemented conditional formatting based on the injury risk formula as well as creating a custom formula for sleep quality. </p>
